            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

What great Paines and Patience His Majesty hath taken and used to prevent and to remove those sad and horrid pressures, cannot be unknowne to many of the Petitioners, and must be to them all, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diligence to suppresse all His Majesties Messages, Answers, and Declarations, and to publish the bitter Libells and Invectives against His Majesty and the Peace of the Kingdome, hath not kept them ignorant in things it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes them so much to know,</p>
            <p>His Majesty commends the Wisedome, and discretion of the Petitioners, in addressing themselves in such a manner to His two Houses of Parliament, who are called together by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59289:4"/>His Majesties Writ, to consult and Counsell Him for the Peace and Happinesse of the Kingdome, and are intrusted by the Petitioners &amp; the whole Kingdome to no other purpose. And if they shall receive the Petitioners as willingly, and take the Expressions in their Petition as much to heart as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty doth; If they shall discover and punish passed Faults by the Rule of those Lawes which are established, and prevent future mischiefes by preparing new Lawes for His Majesties Consent; If they shall satisfie the Petitioners by making such Propositions to His Majesty, as may conduce to a happy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation and preservation of the true Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as may be for His Majesties Safety and Honour, and for the Peace and Prosperity of His Subjects, His Majesty promises the Petitioners, that He will not only incline to such Propositions, but meet and embrace them with His Soule, as the greatest Blessing God Almighty can bestow on Him.</p>
            <p>But if the Petitioners shall find, that any Faction (for it must be a Faction which opposes such just reasonable desires) shall be so prevalent, that the good knowne Lawes of the Land are peremptorily confounded by an arbitrary unlimited Power, in which confusion the Petitioners, and all His other good Subjects, must loose the protection &amp; security of those Lawes; That whilst the Protestant Religion is spoken of and pretended, the memory of the blessed Reformers is slighted and vilified, and the present eminent Professors of it (whose learning and vertue can only stand in the gap against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and other adversaries to it) are disregarded, scorned and censured; And shall discover the great absence of Charity, Modesty and humility in the chief factors for a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; If no Propositions shall be made to His Majesty, or such as His Majesty for His owne Honour and Safety, and for the security and Peace of His Subjects, must not, cannot consent to, His Majesty hopes that the Petitioners and all His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59289:4"/>of <hi>Essex</hi> will looke upon the pressures themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe, as proceeding from the same Persons who endeavour to oppresse His Majesty, and will with some indignation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how unhappily many of them have been made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments unskilfully to contribute to that Torrent which is now ready to overwhelme them, and will consider that no prevailing or successe of these ill men (who now disturbe the publike Peace) can bring ease and quiet to the Kingdom, but that His Majesty and His Posterity must alwayes endeavour to vindicate themselves from that violence: And then the Petitioners by declaring themselves and joyning with their Neighbours, will be able so farre to assist His Majesty, that in short time both King and People, by enjoying what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, will be happy one in the other. And the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners shall not find His Majesty more sollicitous for His owne Rights and Safety, then for their Interest and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
